# Collections / Tag

We support the native Shopify collection url pattern: `/collections/my-shirts/{tag}`

This allows you to filter an existing collection by products that contain `{tag}`.

Whereas Shopify will support multiple tags in the url like `/collections/my-shirts/apple+orange`, we support only a single tag.
